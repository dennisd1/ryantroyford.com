[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) is a powerful, open-source global atlas edited, updated, and maintained by millions of users all over the world. the Wikipedia of maps, it's been called. every year they hold a conference called State of the Map, and i was fortunate enough to make a shirt for the 2013 event. 

(i also got to do a good portion of [the website](http://stateofthemap.us/2013/), too)
