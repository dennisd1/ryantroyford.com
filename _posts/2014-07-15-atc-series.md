the good folks at [Bright Bright Great](http://brightbrightgreat.com/) also run a pay-what-you-want type foundry called the [Avondale Type Co](http://avondaletypeco.com/). they've recently started a series wherein artists choose a font from ATC, and dress up a couple letters in their own style. down the road, the plan is to screen print all the work for a gallery show.

listen, i enjoy ampersands and clean, flowery swooshes as much as the next person. i like flexing my illustration skills and getting in there with a .05 micron pen. but sometimes there just exists the simple urge to take something nice and completely fuck it up.
