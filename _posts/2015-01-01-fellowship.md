every so often, The Epicenter community resource center of Green River, UT invites an artist out to their small town for a month, to create a body of work informed by the location. i rolled the dice, and in June of 2014, i took a long road trip and spent the month exploring the desert, working with the community, and having a goddamn blast.

as much as i’d like to spend all my time making pieces that could hang in a gallery, there’s plenty of time for that when i’m not in such a unique and exciting place. especially in this case, i’m much more interested in collaborating with communities in a way that benefits more than just myself. i spent the majority of my time making shirts for the local Boys & Girls club, designing a sticker for their local thrift store, teaching a screenprinting workshop, and illustrating a poster for a literary event in town, celebrating the life of a local author.

needless to say, it was a truly amazing experience, and i plan to continue to seek out opportunities of this kind.
