this one's a bit older, but it still means a lot to me. my good friends Signals Midwest recorded an LP, and for the vinyl release, wanted a limited-edition screen print tucked inside the sleeve for the first 100 people who ordered it. they asked me to draw something, and next thing i know there are 125 of these on the drying rack.

11x11" on French Speckletone White.
