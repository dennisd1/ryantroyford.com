Fitz & the Tantrums were playing a Lollapalooza aftershow, and needed a poster for the event. not only were they cool enough to have me do it, but they even sent me back a signed copy once everything was done. how cool is that?

3 colors, all hand-drawn, printed on French Speckletone Madero Beach, 19x15, edition of 100-ish. coordinated by the wonderful [Dan Polyak](http://danpolyak.com/).
