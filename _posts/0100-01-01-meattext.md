i was tasked with animating all the markers for [MeatText](http://www.meattext.com/), a location sharing project from Mapbox. when you ask a vegan to animate a dancing steak, this is what you get. 

to see the rest, you'll have to download the (free) app. oh, and pretty much all of them were illustrated by the amazingly talented [Saman Bemel-Benrud](http://trashmoon.com/).
