<div class='desc fixed'>
	<p>a few of my favorite smaller pieces produced during my time at Mapbox. i hardly knew anything about cartography before working there, and as someone who gravitates toward hand-drawn, gritty aesthetics, i was certainly out of my element working at a clean & shiny tech startup. i learned a great deal, though looking back through the archives, there's a lot of projects i wish i had approached differently. i suppose that's what progress feels like.</p>
