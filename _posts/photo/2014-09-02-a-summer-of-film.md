eight rolls of film. that's what it took me, an amateur photographer, to document eight months of my life. well, that and about 1,600 digital stills. cut me some slack - film is expensive. even so, my love for analog photography grows with each exposure, and if i can say so, i believe i'm getting better at it. that's always a nice thing to be able to observe of oneself. 

these photos were taken mostly in Washington, DC; Green River, UT; Asheville, NC; Chicago, IL; and Waves, NC - with a few in various other states of transition. some are deeply personal, holding moments of significant gravity, that i have to admit would not carry as much weight were they shot digitally. others are just keepsakes from my uncalculated ambling, a byproduct of having a camera slung over your shoulder while you try to figure out what it is you want from life.

anyway, i'll try not to ramble too much.

_near the end of my artist residency in Green River, i went for a walk to the edge of town while the sun was setting. i came across this bird who had gotten it's foot caught in the bunched strands of a telephone wire. it trashed & struggled, losing feathers and panting, to no avail. it was truly pitiful in every sense of the word, and i was helpless to free it. i kept walking, trying not to think about it. on my way home, roughly 15 minutes later, i passed the bird again. just as i walked under the wire to take another look, the bird freed itself and flew away in the fading light. mother nature certainly knows how to write a happy ending._
