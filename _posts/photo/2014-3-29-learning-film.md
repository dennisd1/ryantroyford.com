i've long had an affinity for analog design practices, so it was only a matter of time before i felt pulled to the non-digital side of photography, too. i inherited a Minolta XG-1, and bought an XG-7 (from my girlfriend and a less-than-sober ebay purchase, respectively), and gave it a "shot." that's an excellent pun.

upon developing the first rolls with my XG-7, it was quickly apparent that it's seals were corroded and there was a considerable amount of light leaking in (as you'll see). i guess that's what i get for buying a camera for $18 drunk at 2am and not inspecting it before shooting. i've since fixed it, but i don't think the accidental exposure ruins the photos affected. just adds some character. 

anyway, film has been a wonderful excercise in patience, and there's a much closer connection with the final product when you have to know what you're doing before you snap the shutter. looking forward to shooting many more rolls in the future.
