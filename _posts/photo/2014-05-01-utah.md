first round of photos from Utah, this time they're only from my phone. camera photos take longer to edit, so i'll put them up when i get a chance to do that.

there are a lot of relics from the 60's on main street. reminds me of Radiator Springs.

band practice! i'm joining later this week. lots of covers - Ramones, Tom Petty, Weezer - and some originals too. mostly it's just an excuse to hang out and drink some beer while playing tunes.

"Monument Hill" as we call it. a resident bought the land and let artists make two giant concrete sculptures on it. this one is titled "Elements," and i can't remember what the next one is called, but we call it "The Pyramid" or "The Big Middle Finger in the Desert." i like to wake up early and hike up here for a good view of the sunrise over town.

looking off into the desert. most of the town neighborhoods are actually pretty green and well kept.

Evan and Ellise on the top of "G Hill." we climbed up to watch the sunset. many western small towns placed a giant letter on a nearby hill, so passing cars knew what town they were approaching. there's a 30 foot white "G" right beside us, hence the name of the hill.

Green River. it extends beyond the photo a lot, but this is the main neigborhood area.
