maybe someday i'll finally build that fabled, elusive, long sought-after myth of the online portfolio you don't want to tear down after six months. that folkloric trophy floating out there somewhere in the digital ether. maybe that day is today, maybe it isn't.

at any rate, here's the best hand i could cobble together with what i had at my disposal, that doesn't immediately find me scrambling for excuses and uncomfortably grinning like a dipshit. check back in 6-8 weeks and we'll see if the wind has shifted.
