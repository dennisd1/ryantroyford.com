	<p>The Mountain Goats are hands-down one of my favorite active bands. they were rolling through town, and i thought i'd roll the dice and see if they needed a poster. unfortunately they already had someone on the job, but i had already designed these out of excitement, so i printed a few up just for practice. </p>
