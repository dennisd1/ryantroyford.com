	<p>the makers of Estate had a great idea for an app in a world that is bloated with shitty, useless apps: plug in some info, and they'll set your utilities up for you.</p>
	<p>the unflappable <a href='http://33cc77.com/'>Daniel Zarick</a> did the behind-the-scenes work and made everything function well, and i came in to polish up the look, add some illustrations, and make some icons.</p>
