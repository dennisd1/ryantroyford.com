animation has been, and i hope always will be, a serious interest of mine. in college, i thought i wanted to work for Pixar. when the horrors of that industry became apparent, i quickly realized mine was more the path of illustration and design, but in no way did i want to give up animating. it's just too goddamn fun.

 since the end of the NatGeo childrens show on which i was an animator, i unfortunately haven't gotten to do much of it. i haven't yet had the chance to hone my style and experiment like i have with print & illustration. if you're interested in collaborating on a smaller-scale, character based or motion graphics piece, please shoot me an email.
