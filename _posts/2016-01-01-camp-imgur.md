	<p>the good folks at Imgur planned a summer meetup to bring their famous community together IRL. naturally they called it Camp Imgur, and thankfully they recruited me to make them some goodies for it. i got to design the logo, shirts, tote bags, programs, signage - pretty much the whole setup.</p>

	<p>it should come as no suprise that the team there is fun as hell to work with.</p>
