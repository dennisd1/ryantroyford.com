##Album Art

my good friends Boardroom Heroes play a fast, loud brand of punk rock that takes me back to my days of eating shit on a skateboard (like last week). when they asked me to draw them some album art, i was very quick to oblige.

Jump Start Records approached me about doing some work for The Young Leaves, a loud, sludgy pop-punk band from New England. Dinosaur Jr. and Archers of Loaf make this designer weak at the knees, so i was eager to get sketching.
