several years ago, a friend passed along info about something called the Frontier Fellowship. the community center of Green River, UT invites an artist out to their small town in middle of Utah for a month, to create a body of work informed by the location. i rolled the dice, and in June of 2014, i took a long road trip and spent the month exploring the desert, working with the community, and having a goddamn blast. 

as much as i'd to make pieces that could hang in a gallery all the time, there's plenty of time for that when i'm not in such a unique and remote place. especially in this case, i'm much more interested in collaborating with communities in a way that benefits more than just myself. i spent the majority of my time making shirts for the local Boys & Girls club, designing a sticker for their local thrift store, and illustrating a poster for a literary event in town celebrating the life of a local author. 

needless to say, it was a truly amazing experience, and i plan to continue to seek out opportunities of this kind.
