there are really only two things i need to be happy in this world: a motorcycle and the outdoors. i combined them into a print using my favorite quote from the remarkably inspiring John Muir. 

i've [still got a few lying around](http://ryantroyford.bigcartel.com/product/muir-dercycle) if you'd like to pick one up.
