i say this with nothing but love for the guy, but my best friend Matt is a music snob. so much so, that one night he and some other friends of mine hosted a vinyl-only DJ night at our favorite DC watering hole that consisted only of 90's emo and pop-punk. i know, right? the only part where i didn't roll my eyes like a jerk was when they asked me to make a poster for them, which i was more than happy to do.
