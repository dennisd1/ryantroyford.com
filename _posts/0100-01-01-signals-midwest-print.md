Signals Midwest kicks serious ass. aside from the fact that they're very good friends of mine, they always put on a hell of a show, and are some of the kindest, most thankful & genuine dudes i know. so when they put out a new LP and asked me to design & print something for the first 100 people who ordered it, i answered with a resounding "hell yes." 

two-color print on French speckletone white.
