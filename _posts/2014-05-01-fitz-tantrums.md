i was thrilled to be asked to design & print a poster for a Lollapalooza aftershow featuring Fitz & the Tantrums. i had never heard their music because i'm a total square, and after listening, i wanted to make something bright & vibrant but with a little of that grit that i love so much. i hand-drew all 3 layers to allow for all the minor imperfections and brush textures to show through. 

printed on French Speckletone Madero Beach, 19x15, edition of 100-ish. coordinated by the wonderful Dan Polyak.

(side note: i have a few extras left around, email me if you're interested.)
