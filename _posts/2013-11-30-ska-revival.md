i used to play drums in a ska band, which is something i've been living with for a while now. regardless of my past, there are still some good folks out there keeping the scene alive, and sometimes they put together a tour that needs some design work. 

i wanted something very bold & strong, gritty, and iconic. no gradients or clean lines or any of that crap. these didn't end up making the cut, but that's alright.
